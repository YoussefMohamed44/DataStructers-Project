# DataStructers-Project

A larger project / system built in C++ using core data‑structure implementations from scratch.  
Intended as a demonstration of applying data structures and algorithms to build a more complex real-world system.  

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project integrates multiple data structures — linked lists, trees, queues, stacks, graphs, etc. — to build a system with functionalities beyond simple data structure operations.  

**Example Use Case:** banking system (account management, transaction handling, record maintenance) or other systems requiring structured data storage and manipulation.  

## 💡 Motivation

- To move beyond standalone DS implementations and build a functional system.  
- To apply theoretical DSA knowledge to practical application.  
- To showcase how custom data structures can be used in real-world scenarios without relying on standard library containers.  

## 🔧 Key Features / Modules

- Data storage and management using custom data structures.  
- Modules for core logic (e.g. account management, transaction processing).  
- Input/output via console.  
- Error handling and data integrity using correct pointer management and data structure invariants.  

## 🛠 Building & Running

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp <other_sources>.cpp -o app
./app
